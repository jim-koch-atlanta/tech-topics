# Coursera: Generative AI in Software Development

See https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-in-software-development/lecture/FdfHy/course-introduction.

## Course Introduction

This course will teach how to:

* Quickly write & optimize code
* Detect & fix bugs efficiently
* Build projects using GenAI

Generative AI can convert ideas or pseudocode into actual code. It can also help you learn new programming languages & frameworks by providing suggestions for you code. Also, it can modernize and update existing code efficiently.

## Project preview

### Introduction

This project will teach how to create a rule-based chatbot using Amazon Q Developer. The purpose of this project is to:

* Develop a deeper understanding of prompt engineering.
* Gain practical experience integrating GenAI capabilities with rule-based systems.
* Build knowledge in session managed and web-based interfaces.

### What is a rule-based chatbot?

A rule-based chatbot is a program that reponds to user inputs based on predefined rules and patterns. It relies on carefully designed logic to handle specific tasks.

Here's how we will build the chatbot:

1. **Building the chatbot logic**. We'll use Spring Boot to create a web-based chatbot application.

2. **Session management**. Session management will allow us to create a conversational flow. The chatbot will remember the user-selected country for each user, making it possible to provide related information during the session.

3. **Web-based interface**. The chatbot will feature a web-based interface built using Spring Boot.

4. **Leveraging Amazon Q Developer**. Amazon Q Developer will speed up development by suggesting code for both backend and front-end components.

## Course syllabus

### Introduction

We'll be exploring the foundational concepts of GenAI, understanding its unique features, and differentiating it from other AI models. We'll get hands-on experience with Amazon Q Developer, ChatGPT, and GitHub Colpilot.

The course concludes with a project to demonstrate our ability to design and build software using GenAI tools.

### Module 1: AI and building software

We'll start by understanding how GenAI differs from traditional AI models, such as Discriminative AI, by emphasizing its ability to create new data rather than classify or predict it.

### Module 2: AI and digital transformation

The focus here is how AI models, such as decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, work from a simple point of view. It also focuses on how AI integrates with larger organization goals, focusing on its role in digital transformation.

### Module 3: Final project and course wrap-up

The final module is a project that challenges us to apply our knowledge of GenAI in a practical context. We'll design and implement a rule-based chatbot using tools like Amazon Q Developer and GitHub Copilot, showcasing our ability to utilize GenAI to build practical and functioning software.
