# Coursera: Generative AI in Software Development

See https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-in-software-development/lecture/2tZQM/introduction-to-github-copilot.

## Hands-on with Github Copilot

You can get started by visiting the [Github Copilot Features page](https://github.com/features/copilot) to learn more.

To install Github Copilot in IntelliJ, go to the Plugin Marketplace.

**My thoughts**: Github Copilot is **dramatically** more powerful than Amazon Q Developer. The feedback and suggestions are real-time, which makes for much more rapid development.

## Comparing generative AI tools

Use Amazon Q Developer when:

* You’re coding in Java and need real-time feedback on errors and optimizations.

* You want immediate alerts for issues like resource leaks or inefficient code.

* You’re working in IntelliJ or a similar IDE and need a tool that integrates seamlessly.

Use ChatGPT when:

* You’re exploring new programming concepts or frameworks and need detailed explanations.

* You’re troubleshooting a tricky bug and want interactive problem-solving.

* You need guidance on design patterns, debugging strategies, or architectural decisions.

Use GitHub Copilot when:

* You’re working in a supported IDE like Visual Studio Code and need real-time contextual code suggestions.

* You want to save time on repetitive tasks like generating boilerplate code.
