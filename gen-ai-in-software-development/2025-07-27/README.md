## Hands-on with Amazon Q Developer

> A local library is upgrading its system to manage books more efficiently, and you’ve been called in to assist. This lab places you in the role of a junior developer tasked with enabling users to quickly check book availability and update book titles when necessary. You'll use Amazon Q Developer's advanced features, like code suggestions and debugging insights, to enhance your technical skills while improving the library system.
>
> By the end of this lab, you will have:
>
> * Implemented a method to check the availability of books in a library system.
> * Debugged and optimized a method for updating book titles.
> * Leveraged Amazon Q Developer to write, complete, and debug code efficiently.

**My thoughts**: At least in this example, it was incredibly difficult to get Amazon Q Developer to provide the desired code. The `LibrarySystem` class had a member variable `books`. Amazon Q Developer instead provided a code snippet that referenced a non-existent member variable `library`.

## Hands-On with ChatGPT

### How to get the best output from ChatGPT

* **Provide context**. Instead of asking general questions, be more specific.
* **Be precise**. When requesting code or examples, keep your prompts clear and direct.
* **Request clarifications**. If an explanation feels too complex, don’t hesitate to ask for simpler terms.
* **Build on answers**. After receiving a basic response, follow up with advanced or more specific questions.
* **Test and modify code**. Always run the code ChatGPT provides to validate its functionality. Experiment with different inputs or edge cases to deepen your understanding.

### Conclusions

ChatGPT simplifies coding concepts, provides ready-to-use code snippets, and helps debug errors—acting as a reliable assistant in your development workflow. These techniques empower you to learn faster, solve problems more efficiently, and grow as a confident programmer.
