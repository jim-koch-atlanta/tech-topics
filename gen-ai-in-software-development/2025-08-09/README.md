# Coursera: Generative AI in Software Development

## Automating code reviews

Amazon Q Developer teaches best practices and improve code. When writing code manually, common issues like missing input validation, ambiguous variable names, and lack of readability can result in bugs and unexpected behavior.

With Amazon Q Developer, you can highlight the code and select "Fix code". Alternatively, you can could utilize an Amazon Q Chat prompt like:

> Enhance the application code by adding input validation for positive age and loan amounts, with error messages for invalid input. Rename variables to userAge and requestedLoanAmount. Implement error handling with a try-catch block to handle non-numeric input.

Then the AI will offer tailored suggestions to enhance your code.

## Bug detection and fixing

Consider an application that has multiple parts that can update data simultaneously. These are race conditions, which can lead to data discrepancies and errors.

As your AI-powered assistant, Amazon Q Developer can analyze your code, identifies potential bugs, and recommends fixes to address the issues.

Key benefits of early bug detection are:

* **Data integrity**: Ensures data is accurate and unaltered.
* **Reliability**: Ensures the solution process data accurately.
* **Efficiency**: Ensures a smooth application process, and identifies bottlenecks early for faster processing.
* **Security**: Protects personal data.

AI improves bug detection by:

* Spotting patterns.
* Detecting anomalies.
* Understanding context.

## Bug detection and fixing lab

With IntelliJ and Amazon Q Developer, you can highlight a section of code and discuss it in Amazon Q Chat. You can also right-click >> Amazon Q >> **<<option>>** to explain the code, refactor the code, or fix the code.

## Automating Java documentation

Limitations of manual documentation include:

* Lack of detail in descriptions
* Unclear parameter descriptions
* Incomplete documentation
* No examples

With Amazon Q, you can highlight existing documentation and give the prompt, "Improve the documentation." The enhanced documentation saves time by clearing explaining the method's purpose, input, and output.
