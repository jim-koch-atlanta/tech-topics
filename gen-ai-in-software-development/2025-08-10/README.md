# Coursera: Generative AI in Software Development

See https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-in-software-development/lecture/r2E07/software-design-with-ai.

## Software Design with AI

AI can also assist with the software architecture -- structuring projects and fine-tuning workflows.

A good software architecture entails the following aspects:

* Components
* Interfaces
* Design patterns
* Architectural styles

What is the right level of abstraction? What trade-offs of performance, scalability, and stability do we want? Which design patterns should we use?

**Structuring code efficiently is key to creating scalable and maintainable software.**

We can use AI tools to generate standard templates for architectural patterns like MVC or RESTful APIs.

### Useful tools

* **Dependabot**: Identifies out-of-date dependencies.
* **CircleCI**:  A CI/CD solution that provides improved resource utilization.
* **AWS CodeGuru**: Provides real-time feedback on code reviews.

### Over-reliance on AI

Be careful about **over-reliance** on AI solutions. They are best when used as **collaborators** for **repetitive** tasks that follow a standard pattern. They are not useful for creating solutions or outside-the-box thinking.

## Building apps with AI lab

**Goal**: Create a project from scratch using Amazon Q to get the users' information and save it onto a file.

In this lab, we used Amazon Q's `/dev` command to automatically generate code for a User Management application. This was a very simple application for reading user data from the command line and writing it to file.

Amazon Q automatically added unit tests, but it did not do the necessary imports for JUnit. I'd need to figure that out if I want to run the unit tests.

## AI for code explanation

AI is useful for code explanation, because it can simplify complexity, provide context, and offer tips to improve or optimize code.

* **Tip 1**: Ask specific questions.
* **Tip 2**: Understand AI's role. It's an assistant, not a replacement.
* **Tip 3**: Iterate on queries. Ask the AI to simplify or give examples. Think of it as a conversation.
* **Tip 4**: Leverage contextual explanations. How does this piece tie into the overall picture?
* **Tip 5**: Request examples. When the AI explains a concept, have it give sample code.
* **Tip 6**: Adjust for your skill level.
* **Tip 7**: Verify AI output. It might miss context or make incorrect assumptions.
* **Tip 8**: Use AI for optimization. Ask the AI how to make the code cleaner, faster, or clearer.
* **Tip 9**: Document findings.
* **Tip 10**: Expirement and learn.
