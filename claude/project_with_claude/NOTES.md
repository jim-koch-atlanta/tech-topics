My prompt:

```
I would like to build a web app written in PHP. It needs to use Apache for the web server. It needs to run within Kubernetes pods.

* It needs to allow the user to upload a GIF file.
* Uploaded GIFs can be transformed using ImageMagick. The supported transformations are:
  * Resize
  * Crop
  * Rotate
  * Flip
* Once the user has finished transforming the GIF, they can choose to save it.
```
