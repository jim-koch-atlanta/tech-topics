## Workflow

1. First, think through the problem. Read the codebase and write a plan in TODO.md.
2. The plan should be a checklist of TODO items.
3. Check in with me before starting work. I'll verify the plan.
4. Then complete the TODO items one-by-one, marking them off as you go.
5. At every step, give me a high-level explanation of what you changed.
6. Keep every change simple and minimal. Avoid big rewrites.
7. At the end, add a review section in TODO.md summarizing the changes.
